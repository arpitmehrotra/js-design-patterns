# Javascript Design Patterns

1. **Null Object Pattern** - It only requires you to add one extra class/object to your actual code and then instead of returning null, you return that null object that you created, which saves you from doing all the null checks further in the code.

2. **Builder Pattern** - This pattern is useful when you need to create objects that have many different working parts that need to all come together to create one single object.
