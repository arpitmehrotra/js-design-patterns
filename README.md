# Javascript Design Patterns

1. **Null Object Pattern** - It only requires you to add one extra class/object to your actual code and then instead of returning null, you return that null object that you created, which saves you from doing all the null checks further in the code.

2. **Builder Pattern** - This pattern is useful when you need to create objects that have many different working parts that need to all come together to create one single object.

3. **Singleton Pattern** - This pattern is a way of creating a single object but is shared among the bunch of different resources throughout your application without having to recreate that object.

4. **Facade Pattern** - The intent of the Facade pattern is to provide a high-level interface (properties and methods) that makes a subsystem or toolkit easy to use for the client, by hiding the complex functionality in one or more subsystems.

5. **Command Pattern** - The idea of the command pattern is to take the different operations that you want something to do and encapsulate them into individual commands that have a perform and an undo method.
